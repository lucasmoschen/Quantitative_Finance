This is a repository for R studies in the subject Quantitative Finance, a mixture of Econometrics and Probability.

To run the examples, I use R Markdown. In some R enviroment, as RStudio fa√ßa: 

install.packages("rmarkdown")

In cases, I use the R package "Rsafd" of the book: Statistical Analysis of Financial Data in R.
